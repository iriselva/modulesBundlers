# modules and bundlers
## Modal Maker

Welcome to my Module 4 Modules, Package Managers and Bundlers assignment. 
For this project I used [Parcel Bundler](https://parceljs.org/) NPM package manager and ES6 Modules using import export.
This web application is a modal maker where you can change the sizes of the modal.
Hope you like it!

## Usage

+ Html can be found in [src/index.html](src/index.html).
+ All styles are in [src/scss](src/scss).
